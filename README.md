## The rules of pig

The objective of the game is to be the first player to get to 100 points. 

Player 1 always starts off the game. The player whose turn it is throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn. When the player decides to end their turn, their total score gets incremented by their current score.

If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

The rest button restarts the game. 


## Approach


I tried to get the functionality done first. For example, I started with implementing the dice roll function first to see if I can roll the die instead of trying to implement the whole functionality of the dice roll including the logic to detect a 1, and then what happens after, etc. 

I also researched and took inspiration from how people coded their own version of pig.

## Struggles

I struggled with getting things started. It became a lot easier to work on the project once I knew the priority and the order of functions I wanted to implement. It also helped that I had a psuedocode to reference when I was getting stuck

I also struggled reading back at my code because of the similar variable names.

## Improvements

- Dice roll animation
- Implement other ways to play
- Set a textbox so the players can change the score
- Styling changes (button color, font, etc)
- Naming the variables better
- Use ID instead of classes
